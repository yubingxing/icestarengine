	 * <p>Object pooling is the process of storing objects in a pool when they are not in use so as to avoid the
	 * overhead of creating them again and again. In AS3, objects that are tied to the library are expensive
	 * to create. By storing them in a pool for later use you can greatly reduce memory usage and save a handful
	 * of milliseconds every frame. ( This definition was copied from here http://mikegrundvig.blogspot.com/2007/05/as3-is-fast.html)</p>
	 *
	 * <p>This class will return instancies of any given class. When an object is no longer used, if you return it
	 * to the pool it will be available to be used again. In a good implementation there would be some sort of factory
	 * interface and you would provide an initialization method for each class to ensure properties are properly
	 * initialized, but this is not the case here.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>The engine uses this pool mainly to reuse Sprites and MovieClips, which are very expensive to instantiate. You can
	 * use it for you own classes if you want too</p>
	 *
	 * <p><b>IMPORTANT!</b>: This is a very simple implementation of an object Pool. There is no such thing as size control. If one of your scenes
	 * allocated 100 Sprites, for example, once they are returned they will still exist inside the pool and use memory.
	 * You can call objectPool.flush(Class) or objectPool.flush() at anytime to free these resources (after hiding an scene is a good moment).<br>
	 * I decided not to automate this process for now because I'm not sure about the real scenarios this engine will face yet. I may do it in future
	 * releases.</p>
	 *
