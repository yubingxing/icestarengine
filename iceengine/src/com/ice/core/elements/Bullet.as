	 * <p>A bullet is also a moving element, but its particular properties demand an specific class.
	 * Bullets move very fast, therefore its collisions must be resolved using trajectories instead of coordinates.
	 * Also in this engine bullets don't have size to simplify calculations. This doesn't mean they can't look the way
	 * you want: you have control of the render but internally, they will behave as a point travelling in space.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>As of this release, castSahdows, receiveShadows and receiveLights don't apply to fBullets. fBullets don't get
	 * any lighting applied.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>YOU CAN'T CREATE INSTANCES OF THIS OBJECT.<br>
	 * Use scene.createBullet() to add new bullets to an scene. They will be destroyed automatically when they hit something.</p>
	 *
	 * <p><b>Note to developers:</b> bullets are reused. Creating new objects is slow, and depending on your game you could have a lot
	 * being created and destroyed. The engine uses an object pool to reuse "dead" bullets and minimize the amount of new() calls. This
	 * is transparent to you but I think this information can help tracking weird bugs</p>
